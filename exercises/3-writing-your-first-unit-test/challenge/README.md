# Writing your first unit test

This exercise aims to teach the principles of unit testing and how to write a good
unit test. Some of the tests within this challenge are intended to be written using standard
Fortran without the use of a testing framework, in order to teach the principles alone
before covering specific syntax.

## The src code

In [src](./src) you will find a library [temp_conversions.f90](./src/temp_conversions.f90)
which provides functions for converting between various units of temperature. The functions
provided are...

- **fahrenheit_to_celsius**: Which takes in a temperature in Fahrenheit and returns a temperature in Celsius.
- **celsius_to_kelvin**: Which takes in a temperature in Celsius and returns a temperature in Kelvin.

To build this library you csn use either CMake or Make from within the **challenge** directory.

### Building

**Make:**

```sh
make tests # You may need to specify the Fortran compiler with FC=<path/to/compiler>
```

To rebuild after an update, make sure you clean the project first with

```sh
make clean
```

**CMake:**

```sh
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

To rebuild after an update, make sure you clean the project first with by deleting the build directory.

```sh
rm -rf build
```

## The tasks

### Part 1 - Test with Standard Fortran

Imagine you wish to use the temp_conversions library to convert Fahrenheit to Kelvin. We
know that there is no function which does this direct conversion. With this is mind, write
a test, or tests, to give you confidence that temp_conversions can correctly convert
Fahrenheit to Kelvin.

To get you started, the file [test_temp_conversions.f90](./test/standard_fortran/test_temp_conversions.f90)
has been provided. `test_temp_conversions.f90` contains some boilerplate to make writing a
test easier. There is an empty test subroutine `test` provided which takes in a logical
`passed` and a character array `failure_message`. The logical `passed` should indicate if
the test was successful. The character array `failure_message`, should be populated with a
message that will be printed to the terminal in the event that `passed` is `.false.`. Once
the test subroutine is written it should be called within the main body of the test program
as indicated in `test_temp_conversions.f90`.

> Note: If you add a new test file or change the name of `test_temp_conversions.f90`, you will
> need to update list of tests (`test_src`) in [test/pfunit/CMakeLists.txt](./test/pfunit/CMakeLists.txt)

### Part 2 - Convert tests to use pFUnit

#### Writing the test

Convert your tests from [Part 1](#part-1---test-with-standard-fortran), to use
[pFUnit](https://github.com/Goddard-Fortran-Ecosystem/pFUnit).

A file [test_temp_conversions.pf](./test/pfunit/test_temp_conversions.pf) containing a template
for your pFUnit test(s) has been provided. Comments within this file indicate the aspects of
the pFUnit test you must write.

> Note: This template has been written to facilitate conversion of
> [test_temp_conversions.f90](./test/standard_fortran/test_temp_conversions.f90) as provided with this repo
> to pFUnit. If your version of test_temp_conversions.f90, produced in Part 1, is significantly
> different, You may prefer to use a different structure to the one provided in the template.

#### Building the test

- **i. Build your new test(s) with Make** - A top level [Makefile](./Makefile) has already been provided to build the
  src objects and the standard Fortran tests, via [test/standard_fortran/Makefile](./test/standard_fortran/Makefile).
  Add a new Makefile to the [test/pfunit/](./test/pfunit/) dir which will build your new pFUnit test(s). Note that
  the top level [Makefile](./Makefile) is already setup to work with this new Makefile (look for lines which look
  like **"# Uncomment here..."**). Once you have added this Makefile, you should be able to build and run your tests
  via the following command.

  ```sh
  make tests
  ./test/pfunit/tests
  ```
  
  If you are not using the devcontainer, you will likely need to specify the path to your pFUnit include dir. You can do
  this by passing an environment variable like so.

  ```sh
  PFUNIT_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/pfunit/include make tests
  ```

  The Fortran compiler will default to **gfortran**. If you wish to use a different compiler, set the env var, **FC**.

- **ii. Build your new test(s) with CMake** - A top level [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt) has already been provided to
  build the src objects and the standard Fortran tests, via
  [test/standard_fortran/CMakeLists.txt](./test/standard_fortran/CMakeLists.txt). Add a new CMakeLists.txt to the
  [test/pfunit/](./test/pfunit/) dir which will build your new pFUnit test(s). Note that the top level
  [CMakeLists.txt](./CMakeLists.txt) is already setup to work with this new CMakeLists.txt, all you need to do is
  add the pFUnit lib to the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` when building i.e...

  ```bash
  cmake -B build -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/path/to/pfunit/install
  cmake --build build
  ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
  ```

> If you are using the devcontainer, there is an installation of pFUnit at /home/vscode/pfunit/build/installed
