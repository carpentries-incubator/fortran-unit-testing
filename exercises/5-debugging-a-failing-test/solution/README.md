# Understanding test output - Solution: Debugging a failing unit test

## Task 1

> Which tests are failing?

The pFUnit output shown below indicates that the failing test is from the `test_transpose_suite` testsuite and, more
specifically, is testing a `3x3 Asymmetric` matrix.

## Task 2

> What is causing these failures? Is it the test(s) or the src code?

The tests appear to be correct as we are inputting

```F90
input_matrix(1,:) = [1,4,0]
input_matrix(2,:) = [6,1,0]
input_matrix(3,:) = [0,3,1]
```

and expect the transposed version to be

```F90
expected_output_matrix(1,:) = [1,6,0]
expected_output_matrix(2,:) = [4,1,3]
expected_output_matrix(3,:) = [0,0,1]
```

Therefore, the problem likely lies in the src code itself. Taking a closer look at `matrix_transforms::transpose` we can see the
issue. When we are transposing `temp_matrix` into `matrix` we are not flipping the order of the indices, but this is required to
populate the transpose. This also explains why the test(s) of the 3×3 identity matrix are not failing as the identity is a
symmetric matrix and is equal to its own transpose, thus the order of the indices would not matter.

## Task 3

> Fix the tests/src.

We can fix the src with the following change
